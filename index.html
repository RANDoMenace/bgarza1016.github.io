          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am a recent graduate from General Assembly in Downtown Los Angeles. Each three weeks we would learn the basics of a language and turning that information into a restful application. I've studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and the MEAN stack. There we worked on projects using GitHub for tracking our progress, Trello for agile development, and Black/ White Hat Scrum for our retrospectives. I am used to working solo, but have experience also working in a group project or two.
          <br>
          <br>
          I can honestly say since I was young I was very interested in programming. Although it was not my first career choice I gained a good sense for teamwork and communication from my days as a firefighter. In the end I was in search for a place where I belonged, and ended up leaving the fire service.
          <br>
          <br>
          My next choice was Animation, because I was somewhat of an artist in my spare time. After three years of schooling I still found myself gravitating towards scripting.
          <br>
          <br>
          Still in search for where I belonged I moved into information technology with the help of some good friends. I am a curious self-starter enthusiastic about self-teaching and problem solving.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now with the arrival of my baby girl Abigale, I finally decided to go BIG or stay in IT. I decided to attend General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. I couldn't be happier about this decision. I love the people and the work I do. I now know who I am, I am a programmer.</p>

              I absolutely love computers. I love building them. I love installing distros on them.Most of all I love playing with them. The next step for me was to learn how to talk to them. Programmer, developer, hacker. The thought of being called these titles excited me in a way that showed from ear to ear. Once I confirmed my seat with General Assembly I was hooked. Javascript, Ruby, Front-end, Back-end, it was all within my grasp. Since day zero I have hit the ground running.

              At some point in my life I had dreams of breaking into the video game industry. I lived for the cutscenes in video games. They were like the icing on top of the cake once you defeated a difficult level. Every now and again I like to take a martial arts scene or move and animate to it. Just for the fun of it.
